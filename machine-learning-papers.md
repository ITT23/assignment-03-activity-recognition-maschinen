# Questions about Machine Learning Papers

## What are some common use cases for machine learning in practical applications or research prototypes?

Kostakos and Musolesi name various use cases for machine learning. In their remarks, they focus on machine learning from an HCI perspective. In this field, activity or gesture recognition, wearable computing and thereby modeling human behavior are very common use cases for machine learning. With developing user interfaces, machine learning can help to react to users' input or even predict it. Furthermore, it also allows for optimizing the use of system resources such as batteries.

## Which problems of machine learning do the authors of the papers identify?

Kostakos et al. see the need for detailed performance evaluation of machine learning systems. Regarding generalizability to the entire population, it is essential to think about how to gather and handle train data, since there might be different user groups.
Another issue, Kostakos et al. face, is the risk of misinterpreting results of research with ML-based approaches because of its low transparency. Calculating the accuracy of a predictive machine learning model should be no real alternative to hypothesis testing but a subsequent metric. Looking at machine learning results, one cannot necessarily distinguish between causality and correlation.
They also insist on not only using accuracy itself as a measure of successful prediction. Instead, the accuracy should always be compared to a baseline. Depending on the use case, the baseline performance can already be quite high. Thus, a high value for accuracy may be less profitable than a lower value for a use case with very low baseline performance. So, besides the accuracy, it is important to take other performance measurements into account. In the domain of HCI additionally gathering qualitative data is crucial to gain an understanding of human behavior.

## What are the credentials of the authors with regard to machine learning? Have they published research on machine learning (or using machine-learning techniques) previously?

Kostakos and Musolesi seem to look at the topic of machine learning from an almost exclusively HCI perspective. Previous work dealing with machine learning, for example, uses this technology to investigate and enhance users' behavior when interacting with a computer â€“ mostly a smartphone. Here, it is clearly important not only to consider metrics such as accuracy but also to ask users about their experiences. However, this does not necessarily mean that this is also beneficial for evaluating machine learning approaches in any other use cases.
